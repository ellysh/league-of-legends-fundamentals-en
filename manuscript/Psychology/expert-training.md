## 1.1 Learning process

League of Legends is a challenging esports discipline. There are several reasons for that:

* It is a team game where participants must interact effectively.

* The cost of mistakes is very high because of the snowball effect.

* Each player has a limited influence on the game.

* The teams change in every game.

* There is no guarantee that the player will get his champion.

* There is no guarantee that the player will get his role.

I> A **snowball** effect occurs when a player or team gains an advantage. Then the lead grows and becomes increasingly difficult to reverse.

This book addresses ranked games only. All points mentioned above pertain to them.

League of Legends is a fast, chaotic, and mechanically demanding game. Furthermore, the human brain cannot solve this game. In the same way, it is impossible to [solve chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solving_chess). In League of Legends, the problem is the vast amount of information that falls on players every second.

It takes months for a beginner to learn the basics of League of Legends. During this time, he becomes familiar with essential mechanics. However, many aspects of the game are still out of his scope.

High-level players continue to learn. They are deepening their knowledge and understanding of various aspects of the game. It is impossible to develop and improve one’s rank without ongoing learning.

The learning process is crucial for players of all levels. Let's explore it in detail.

### 1.1.1 Deliberate practice

In the early 1990s, Swedish psychologist [Anders Ericsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Anders_Ericsson) studied the learning process. He conducted an experiment involving music academy students. The scientist divided them into three groups:

1. Potential world-class stars.
2. Promising musicians.
3. Mediocre musicians.

Each participant shared insights about his educational process and leisure activities. Based on this information, the scientist evaluated the quantity and quality of the aspiring musician's studies.

Anders Ericsson reached the following conclusions. Musicians in the first group had practiced for about 10000 hours by the age of 20. Students in the second group had spent approximately 7500 hours practicing during the same period, while those in the third group had only practiced for about 5000 hours. The scientist concluded that regular practice is essential for developing skills.

Anders Ericsson made one more conclusion. It is crucial not only the quantity of practice, but also its quality. He introduced the special term to emphasize this idea:

I> **Deliberate practice** is intentional and systematic work aimed at improving a learner's performance.

Deliberate practice has several distinctive features. **First**, it requires a high level of attention and concentration. The student sets specific goals and works towards achieving them. At the same time, he strives to eliminate any automatic or thoughtless actions.

**Second**, deliberate practice aims to expand the learner's current capabilities. He chooses specific exercises based on this purpose. Often, this focuses not on strengths, but rather on addressing mistakes and weaknesses.

**Third**, deliberate practice requires feedback. The learner must receive immediate feedback on his performance. A trainer, teacher, or coach provides this support. Feedback points out mistakes and ways to correct them.

**Fourth**, the learner focuses on details during deliberate practice. He halts his unconscious attempts to perform certain actions automatically. Instead, the learner visualizes a flawless performance in every detail and works towards achieving it.

Deliberate practice is inherently unpleasant. It requires focus, continuous effort, and involves the discomfort of admitting mistakes. Frequently, the learner must repeat the same exercises many times until he achieves his goal.

Deliberate practice is not feasible in certain fields. Three essential requirements must be met for a field to develop expert skills:

1. The presence of a repeatable context with stable patterns.

2. The opportunity for long-term practice.

3. Prompt and clear feedback.

League of Legends meets all these criteria.

### 1.1.2 Recognition of templates

Anders Ericsson's research explains how experts in various fields acquire skills. However, a critical question arises: what exactly are they learning? Let's explore the essence of their skills.

In the late 1990s, [Fernand Gobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernand_Gobet) and Peter Lane developed the cognitive architecture CHREST (Chunk Hierarchies and REtrieval STructures). This model illustrates human cognitive processes. It explains how individuals perceive, process, and remember information.

Two mechanisms are essential to the model:

1. [**Chunking**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)) is the process of combining elements with low information content into larger units called **chunks**.

2. **Recognition of templates**. A **template** is a cognitive structure that represents how a person perceives his environment. This structure consists of interconnected chunks of information.

Let's begin with **the first mechanism — chunking**. For example, consider the phone number 84956352167. Without breaking it down into chunks, you'd have to remember each digit individually: 8, 4, 9, 5, 6, 3, 5, 2, 1, 6, 7. This task is quite tricky.

You can divide the number into meaningful groups of digits to make the task easier. To do this, it's essential to understand the structure of phone numbers. The number in our example follows the specific scheme:

* 8 — country code
* 495 — city code
* 6352167 — subscriber number.

We have three blocks: 8, 495, and 6352167. They are much easier to remember than the original long number 84956352167.

The subscriber number is typically divided into three parts: 635-21-67. Each segment individually has no specific meaning. However, this division follows the idea of grouping: breaking a number into blocks to enhance memorability.

**The second mechanism is recognition of templates**. Let's use an example again. Refer to Figure 1-1.

{caption: "Figure 1-1. Recognition of the template", height: "30%"}
![Recognition of the template](images/Psychology/traffic-light-red.png)

You can easily recognize the traffic light in the image. It's red. If you see it while walking, you'll instinctively want to stop.

The silhouette of a traffic light serves as a familiar template for every city resident. This familiarity indicates that our memory has a cognitive structure that aligns with the typical shape of a traffic light. This structure contains three variables or slots. They represent the state of one of the three lamps. The value of each slot is linked to a specific action: either to stand or to walk.

In general, templates shape human behavior by evoking memories, helping us predict events, and providing a general understanding of our surroundings. Complex templates include variables that can change. These variables enable people to absorb information that resembles their existing knowledge more quickly.

Here is the example. The child has seen only two-lamp traffic lights. Therefore, he will find it easier to understand how a three-lamp traffic light works. However, if the child has never seen a traffic light, it will take him longer to understand how it works.

According to the CHREST model, human learning involves constructing a network of templates. This network has a hierarchical structure. It links new knowledge to familiar templates stored in long-term memory.

The network of templates is formed from the perception of a broad range of stimuli. Essentially, it results from practice and feedback. These stimuli represent the specific subject field. When they affect the learner, the individual starts to recognize templates. He compares the regularities with existing templates stored in long-term memory. If there is a complete or partial match, new information is absorbed much more quickly. If there is no match, repeated exposure to the stimulus is necessary. This process helps to consolidate patterns in memory, making them available for retrieval when needed.

The CHREST model explains the problem-solving process in terms of template recognition. When an expert faces a problem, he draws on a network of templates stored in his long-term memory. He analyzes the problem's conditions and looks for typical features that can act as stimuli for their recognition system. These stimuli help the expert locate relevant information in long-term memory. Once the expert identifies an appropriate template, the associated knowledge is then activated and stored in short-term memory.

When the expert locates the appropriate template, the relevant knowledge can offer a ready-made solution to the problem at hand. If that doesn't occur, the expert can recall a previously successful strategy used in a similar situation. Additionally, this related knowledge can help predict the likely outcomes of different actions. Using these predictions, the expert can formulate a solution for a new problem.

### 1.1.3 Player skills

>>>R1

We have learned how experts acquire knowledge and the essence of their expertise. Now, let's examine the skills of a League of Legends player through the CHREST model.

>>>

First of all, we need to understand what is a typical template in League of Legends. The game is based on the model of a battle between two armies. Each side has a number of active objects that operate simultaneously. Each object has a set of parameters, which together define its properties.

League of Legends is an information model, not a material one. Therefore, the parameters of all objects are represented by a set of numbers in the program's memory. The game interface displays these parameters in two ways: in their raw form as numbers or as graphical elements. This means that the typical cognitive template in League of Legends is a set of numbers, graphical elements, or a combination of both.

When an experienced player works with a stream of information about the current state of a model, he performs chunking. This way, he combines elements with low information content into larger units. This creates a hierarchical structure with different levels of abstraction.

Let's look at an example. A player presses Tab and checks the status of his opponent on lane. The player groups opponent's stats into a single cognitive block. Next, the player checks information on all other champions of the enemy team. He creates a separate block with the corresponding stats for each champion. Next, player combines these blocks. The result is a larger unit, which is also a cognitive block. It describes the overall state of the enemy team. Player use this unit to get answers for general strategic questions. For example, is the enemy team stronger or weaker than us? The player chooses his action depending on the answer.

Let's start with the template concept discussed above. Then a League of Legends player should have the following skills:

1. **Ability to group (chunking)** object parameters into blocks. The best players do this very effectively. This way, they take into account most of the model parameters they know at the moment.

2. **Detecting templates** in the received blocks. The more advanced the player, the more templates at different levels of abstraction he knows. Therefore, he sees many more opportunities than a beginner.

3. **Decision making** involves choosing the appropriate action for a detected template. A strong player knows not only more templates, but also more options for each one. In other words, when the strong player sees an opportunity, he knows exactly how to take advantage of it.

4. **Planning**. The template can point out the opponent's mistake. It may not be possible to immediately get benefit from it. However, a certain sequence of actions could do it. A strong player can quickly and accurately create such sequences. This skill is called macromanagement.

5. **Execution**. After choosing an appropriate action or making a plan, the player must carry it out. This skill is called micromanagement.

I> [**Macromanagement**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy#Micromanagement_and_macromanagement) (macro) encompasses broad strategic aspects of gameplay. It focuses on the overall course of the game and long-term planning.

I> [**Micromanagement**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromanagement_(gameplay)) (micro) means carefully controlling the actions of a game character.

We've looked at five player skills. No single one can be called the most important. All are equally important:

* Without effective grouping, the player will miss important aspects of the model's state.

* Without knowing the templates, the player will not understand the events taking place and will miss the opportunities.

* Without knowledge of the appropriate actions for each template, the player will not be able to plan and react correctly to events.

* Without good execution skills, a player will not take advantage of the opportunity that opens up.
