## 1.2 Barriers to learning

>>>R1

League of Legends meets all the requirements for deliberate practice. However, less than a third of players actually do it. Only those players effectively learn and develop their skills.

According to statistics, approximately 75% of all players are constantly in the bottom four ranks: iron, bronze, silver, and gold. In other words, most players are stuck below the middle of the rankings. Why aren't they learning and growing? Let's try to answer this question.

I> The [**Elo rating system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) is a method for calculating the relative skill of a player. It assigns a numerical rating to each player, reflecting his current skill. After each game, the ratings are adjusted based on the outcome. The winner receives points, while the loser loses them.

### 1.2.1 Willpower

>>>R1

The main barrier to effective learning is weak self-control and discipline. There's a subtle difference between these concepts. **Self-control** allows you to avoid undesirable behavior, such as not eating dessert at night. **Discipline** helps you achieve desired behavior, such as going for a morning jog. Both qualities are related to the concept of willpower.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, American psychologist [Roy Baumeister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Baumeister) conducted a series of experiments. He studied human abilities for self-control. The scientist published his results in the book "Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength".

Roy Baumeister's experiments showed that all types of effort (cognitive, emotional, and physical) utilize a common and limited resource. The scientist called it **willpower**. Any effort depletes this resource, just as physical exertion tires muscles. Moreover, willpower is needed for all types of self-control: managing attention, concentrating on a difficult task, resisting temptation, and so on.

Participants of experiments performed various tasks that depleted their willpower. For example, the subjects were asked not to eat chocolate buns lying on the table. Instead, they were to eat bitter radishes. This task required self-control. The participants then solved challenging puzzles. The group that had previously resisted the temptation to eat the bun gave up on the puzzles more quickly than the control group. Roy Baumeister suggested that the first stage of the experiment exhausted the participants' self-control resources. The scientist called this phenomenon ego depletion.

I> **Ego depletion** refers to reduced ability of a person to regulate his thoughts, feelings, and actions.

In his book, Roy Baumeister explores the problem of a lack of self-control and discipline in detail. He offers the following advices for developing these qualities:

1. **Regularly focus on changing your habitual behavior**. For example, this could be monitoring your posture or using your non-dominant hand for routine activities (brushing your teeth, using a computer mouse, etc.).

2. **Good habits**. The scientist claims that showing discipline in one area of ​​life affects all others. This means that habits such as regular cleaning and exercise will increase self-control during gaming sessions.

3. **Clear and simple rules**. It's easier to curb impulsive behavior when it's constrained by clearly defined rules. For example, a rule to end a gaming session after two consecutive losses.

4. **Motivation**. You need to clearly visualize the purpose and the end result of some activity, to force yourself to regularly expend energy on it.

5. **Maintain your willpower** at a healthy level and **avoid ego depletion**. You can achieve this through getting enough rest and proper nutrition.

Developing willpower helps a player learn more effectively and prevents burnout. It is important because deliberate practice is no longer possible in the exhausted state.

I> **Burnout** is a progressive physical and mental exhaustion in response to overexertion.

### 1.2.2 Self-control

>>>R1

In League of Legends, players are constantly encountered with a number of factors that push them to make impulsive decisions. Here are some of these factors:

1. Cognitive distortion **loss aversion**. It leads to the desire to recoup rating points after a loss.

2. **Element of randomness in the game**: unpredictable team compositions, impossibility of calculating the consequences of all decisions, unforeseen situations, etc.

3. [**Tilt**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt_(poker)) is a state of intense frustration or anger that negatively impacts a player's performance.

4. **Unrealistic expectations** regarding player's progress and the quality of games. This is one of the main causes of tilt.

5. **Emotional swings** after alternating victories and defeats. Is affects the quality of games and interfere with decision making.

I> [**Loss aversion**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion) is a behavioral anomaly that appears itself in risky situations. It involves people experiencing greater pain from a loss than pleasure from an equivalent gain. In other words, losses are felt more intensely than gains.

I> Coach Curtis discusses the topic of tilt in detail in the [next video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UJtqKi11uo).

Impulsive decisions seriously interfere the learning process. A typical example is the decision to continue a gaming session in a state of ego depletion. In this case, the player lacks the energy to concentrate and operates on autopilot. The quality of the game deteriorates, and deliberate practice is impossible.

Self-control is something that can protect a player from impulsive decisions. Self-control doesn't work in a state of ego depletion, when the willpower resource is already depleted. Therefore, the player must prioritize preserving this resource.

There are several solutions to use your willpower more economically.

**First**, a player needs to properly organize his approach to the game. Coaches recommend holding a series of gaming sessions throughout the day. Each session consists of 2-3 games and lasts no longer than 3 hours. When the session ends, the player must take a break, regardless of the results. The break should last at least 15-20 minutes.

After each game, the player should evaluate the result. If performance has dropped, the session should be stopped immediately. No more ranked games should be played that day. The idea is to make successful sessions longer and unsuccessful ones shorter.

**Secondly**, it's important to avoid any emotionally charged communication during and after the game. This will prevent a player from wasting his willpower on unnecessary emotions.

The game offers the following types of communication:

1. Verbal communication during a game:

   * General chat – both allies and opponents can use this chat.

   * Team chat – only allies can use this chat.

2. Visual communication:

   * Enemy emotion icons.

   * Ally emotion icons.

   * Ally pings.

3. Verbal communication after a game:

   * General chat – both allies and opponents can use this chat.

Of these communication methods, the most informative is pinging of teammates. Everything else should be disabled in the game settings. In the vast majority of cases, this communication is uninformative. Players typically use it to vent.

Teammates' pings can also have an emotional tone if they're spammed. In this case, this player should be individually muted.

**Thirdly**, playing with friends reduces the quality of games. The amplification of emotions in groups is a well-known psychological phenomenon. It is confirmed by such phenomena as [emotional contagion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_contagion), the crowd effect, [collective effervescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_effervescence), and others. Experiencing any strong emotions drains willpower. This interferes with self-control and provokes impulsive actions.

**Fourth**, the player must replenish his willpower during and after the session. Roy Baumeister's experiments have shown that ego depletion can be partially offset by consuming glucose. The scientist recommends foods with a low [**glycemic index**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index), which are digested slowly. He also emphasizes the importance of adequate sleep. Lack of sleep disrupts the body's overall glucose metabolism. This affects self-control.

### 1.2.3 Repeatable context

>>>R1

Another barrier to learning is related to the conditions that the player creates for himself.

League of Legends has a repeatable context for learning. The problem is that it's so complex that a player cannot master it completely. The entire game can be thought of as five distinct disciplines. Each discipline corresponds to one of five roles on a team. Each role is suited to a specific set of champions. These champions can be compared to specializations within each discipline.

Let's draw a parallel with expert training. A role on a team is a field of activity. For example, music or carpentry. A champion is a tool for working in a chosen field. For example, a violin or a piano.

A beginner player doesn't understand that each role is a separate discipline. Therefore, he frequently switches between roles. Thereby, the player completely changes the context of his learning. It's like trying to master music and carpentry at the same time. That is possible, but it requires much more effort and time.

The need for a repeatable context leads to the following rule:

> The higher a player's specialization, the faster he will learn and progress. High specialization in League of Legends means choosing only one role and only one champion.

Usually, a player switches roles and champions due to a lack of self-control.

### 1.2.4 Feedback

>>>R1

The final barrier to learning is a lack of feedback. Feedback is just as essential to deliberate practice as repeated context.

A player may spend a lot of time in ranked games. But this doesn't mean he is actively learning. He could simply be performing the same actions on autopilot. In this case, the player doesn't reflect on his decisions or learn from his mistakes.

Let's consider what autopilot is from the perspective of the CHREST architecture. In this state, the player reduces the entire set of possible situations to a minimal set of rough patterns. For each pattern, the player considers only one course of action. For example, the jungler chooses the same path for the first clear in every game.

Because League of Legends is a complex game, some basic, routine actions (like executing combos) have to be performed on autopilot. This reduces cognitive load and allows players to focus on more important aspects of the game. The problem is that autopilot gradually permeates all player actions and decisions, which can interfere with the ability to perform a role in the team well.

Feedback solves the autopilot problem. It allows player to correct ingrained habits that lead to mistakes. Feedback can be obtained in two ways: coaching and self-coaching.

**Quality coaching** isn't a lecture or a video guide from an expert. It's an analysis of a player's replay or his actions in real time. The coach points out mistakes and explains the correct course of action in a given situation. This way, the coach corrects the player's faulty cognitive patterns and his reactions to them.

Self-coaching consists of three steps:

1. Gathering information about the game.
2. Analyzing your replay.
3. Correcting mistakes.

First, the player learns a new concept or game mechanic. The source of information can be anything: a video guide, a recording of someone else's coaching session, an article, a book, etc. Then the player watches his replay. He checks when and why his actions deviate from the recommended ones. The player remembers his mistakes and tries to correct them in the next game. The self-coaching session is then repeated until the concept is mastered.

A lack of self-control and discipline often leads to a lack of feedback. When a player continues a session tired, he lacks the energy to actively think. In such a situation, he will always play on autopilot. This is a problem with self-control. When a player can't bring himself to analyze his mistakes, it's a problem with discipline.
