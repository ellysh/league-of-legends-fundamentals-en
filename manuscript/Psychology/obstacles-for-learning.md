## 1.2 Barriers to learning

League of Legends meets all the criteria for deliberate practice. However, less than a third of players actually engage in it. Only those players who do so effectively learn and develop their skills.

Statistics show that around 75% of all players consistently find themselves in the bottom four ranks: iron, bronze, silver, and gold. This means that the majority of players are stuck below the middle of the rankings. Why aren't they learning and growing? Let's explore this question.

I> The [**Elo rating system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) is a method used to calculate the relative skill levels of players. Each player is assigned a numerical rating that reflects his current skill. After every game, these ratings are adjusted based on the outcome: the winner receives points, while the loser loses points.

### 1.2.1 Willpower

The primary barrier to effective learning is a lack of self-control and discipline. While these concepts are closely related, there is a subtle difference between them. **Self-control** enables you to resist undesirable behaviors, like avoiding dessert at night. **Discipline** empowers you to pursue desired behaviors, such as going for a morning jog. Both qualities are closely tied to the concept of willpower.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, American psychologist [Roy Baumeister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Baumeister) conducted a series of experiments to study human self-control abilities. He published his findings in the book "Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength".

Roy Baumeister's experiments showed that all types of effort (cognitive, emotional, and physical) draw on a common and limited resource. The scientist called it **willpower**. Any effort depletes this resource, just like physical exertion tires out muscles. Willpower is essential for various forms of self-control, including managing attention, focusing on challenging tasks, resisting temptation, and so on.

Participants of experiments performed various tasks that depleted their willpower. For example, they were instructed not to eat the chocolate buns on the table. Instead, they had to consume bitter radishes. This task required significant self-control. After completing it, the participants were asked to solve challenging puzzles. Those who had previously resisted the temptation to eat the buns gave up on the puzzles more quickly than the control group. Roy Baumeister proposed that the first task exhausted the participants' self-control resources. He called this phenomenon "ego depletion".

I> **Ego depletion** refers to the reduced ability of a person to regulate his thoughts, feelings, and actions.

In his book, Roy Baumeister explores the problem of a lack of self-control and discipline in detail. He provides practical advice for developing these qualities:

1. **Regularly focus on altering your habitual behaviors**. For example, this could involve paying attention to your posture or using your non-dominant hand for everyday tasks (such as brushing your teeth or using a computer mouse).

2. **Good habits**. The scientist claims that being disciplined in one area of life positively impacts all others. This means that habits like regular cleaning and exercise can boost self-control during gaming sessions.

3. **Clear and simple rules** help to constrain impulsive behavior. For example, a rule to stop a gaming session after two consecutive losses.

4. **Motivation**. You need to clearly visualize the purpose and final result of some activity. This helps you consistently invest energy into it.

5. **Keep your willpower** at a healthy level and **prevent ego depletion**. You can achieve this by getting sufficient rest and proper nutrition.

Building willpower enables a player to learn more effectively and avoid burnout. It is crucial because deliberate practice becomes impossible in a state of exhaustion.

I> **Burnout** is a state of physical and mental exhaustion caused by excessive stress and overexertion.

### 1.2.2 Self-control

In League of Legends, players frequently encounter factors that drive them to make impulsive decisions. Here are some of those factors:

1. Cognitive distortion **loss aversion**. It leads to the desire to recoup rating points after a loss.

2. **Element of randomness in the game**: unpredictable team compositions, the inability to calculate the consequences of all decisions, unforeseen situations, etc.

3. [**Tilt**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt_(poker)) is a state of intense frustration or anger that negatively affects a player's performance.

4. **Unrealistic expectations** regarding the player's progress and the quality of games. This is one of the leading causes of tilt.

5. **Emotional swings** after alternating victories and defeats. It affects game quality and interferes with decision-making.

I> [**Loss aversion**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion) is a behavioral phenomenon that occurs in risky situations. In these scenarios, people experience greater pain from a loss than pleasure from an equivalent gain. In other words, losses are felt more intensely than gains.

I> Coach Curtis thoroughly discusses the topic of tilt in the [following video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UJtqKi11uo).

Impulsive decisions seriously interfere with the learning process. A typical example is the decision to continue a gaming session while in the state of ego depletion. In this case, the player lacks the energy to concentrate and operates on autopilot. This leads to a decline in gameplay quality and makes deliberate practice impossible.

Self-control can protect a player from impulsive decisions. However, it doesn't work in a state of ego depletion, when the willpower resource is gone. Thus, players must prioritize conserving this resource.

There are several ways to use willpower more effectively.

**First**, a player needs to organize his approach to the game properly. Coaches recommend scheduling a series of gaming sessions throughout the day. Each session should include 2-3 games and last no more than 3 hours. Once a session ends, the player must take a break, regardless of the outcome. The break should last at least 15-20 minutes.

The player should assess the results after each game. If he notices a decline in his performance, he should stop the gaming session immediately and refrain from playing any more ranked games that day. The goal is to extend successful sessions while shortening unsuccessful ones.

**Secondly**, it is essential to avoid emotionally charged communication during and after the game. This helps a player conserve willpower by not wasting it on unnecessary emotions.

The game offers the following types of communication:

1. Verbal communication during a game:

   * General chat – both allies and opponents can write there.

   * Team chat – only allies can write there.

2. Visual communication:

   * Enemy emotion icons.

   * Ally emotion icons.

   * Ally pings.

3. Verbal communication after a game:

   * General chat – both allies and opponents can write there.

The most informative communication type is pinging teammates. All other options should be disabled in the game settings, as they are generally uninformative. Players often use verbal communication and emotion icons to vent their frustrations.

Teammates' pings can convey an emotional tone when they are spammed. In this situation, the player should mute the specific teammate individually.

**Thirdly**, playing with friends lowers the quality of games. The amplification of emotions in groups is a well-known psychological phenomenon. Some concepts confirm it as [emotional contagion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_contagion), the crowd effect, [collective effervescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_effervescence), and others. Experiencing intense emotions depletes willpower. This interferes with self-control and may lead to impulsive actions.

**Fourth**, the player should replenish his willpower during and after the gaming session. Research by Roy Baumeister indicates that consuming glucose can mitigate ego depletion. He recommends foods with a low [**glycemic index**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index), which are digested slowly. Additionally, the scientist highlights the importance of getting adequate sleep. Lack of sleep disrupts the body's overall glucose metabolism and can negatively impact self-control.

### 1.2.3 Repeatable context

Another barrier to learning is the conditions that the player creates for himself.

League of Legends provides a repeatable context for learning. But there is one problem. The game is so complex that a player cannot master it completely. We can break down the game into five distinct disciplines. Each discipline corresponds to a specific role on a team. Each role is suited to a particular set of champions. We can compare these champions to specializations within each discipline.

Let's draw a parallel between the training of a player and an expert. Each role in a team represents a distinct field of activity, similar to music or carpentry. Each champion is a tool for working in a chosen field, like a violin or a piano in music.

A beginner player often does not realize that each role in the game is a distinct discipline. As a result, he frequently switches between roles. Therefore, the player completely changes the context of his learning. It is similar to attempting to master music and carpentry at the same time. That is possible, but it requires much more effort and time.

The need for a repeatable context leads to the following rule:

> The higher a player's specialization, the faster he will learn and progress. In League of Legends, high specialization means selecting only one role and only one champion.

Usually, a player changes his role and champion because of a lack of self-control.

### 1.2.4 Feedback

>>>R1

The final barrier to learning is a lack of feedback. Feedback is just as essential to deliberate practice as repeated context.

A player may spend a lot of time in ranked games. But this doesn't mean he is actively learning. He could simply be performing the same actions on autopilot. In this case, the player doesn't reflect on his decisions or learn from his mistakes.

Let's consider what autopilot is from the perspective of the CHREST architecture. In this state, the player reduces the entire set of possible situations to a minimal set of rough patterns. For each pattern, the player considers only one course of action. For example, the jungler chooses the same path for the first clear in every game.

Because League of Legends is a complex game, some basic, routine actions (like executing combos) have to be performed on autopilot. This reduces cognitive load and allows players to focus on more important aspects of the game. The problem is that autopilot gradually permeates all player actions and decisions, which can interfere with the ability to perform a role in the team well.

Feedback solves the autopilot problem. It allows player to correct ingrained habits that lead to mistakes. Feedback can be obtained in two ways: coaching and self-coaching.

**Quality coaching** isn't a lecture or a video guide from an expert. It's an analysis of a player's replay or his actions in real time. The coach points out mistakes and explains the correct course of action in a given situation. This way, the coach corrects the player's faulty cognitive patterns and his reactions to them.

Self-coaching consists of three steps:

1. Gathering information about the game.
2. Analyzing your replay.
3. Correcting mistakes.

First, the player learns a new concept or game mechanic. The source of information can be anything: a video guide, a recording of someone else's coaching session, an article, a book, etc. Then the player watches his replay. He checks when and why his actions deviate from the recommended ones. The player remembers his mistakes and tries to correct them in the next game. The self-coaching session is then repeated until the concept is mastered.

A lack of self-control and discipline often leads to a lack of feedback. When a player continues a session tired, he lacks the energy to actively think. In such a situation, he will always play on autopilot. This is a problem with self-control. When a player can't bring himself to analyze his mistakes, it's a problem with discipline.
