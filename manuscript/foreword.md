# Foreword

>>>R1

League of Legends was released in 2009. Two years later, its first professional tournament was held. Thirteen years later, the game remains the leading esports discipline in terms of viewership and the number of annual competitions.

Today, League of Legends continues to attract new players. Its success is attributed to a variety of factors: free access, regular updates, relatively short games, and the ability to play with friends.

Every League of Legends player eventually tries ranked games. At this moment, he realizes how difficult this game really is. In ranked games, victory is the only thing that matters to the participants. They invest significant effort, money, and time into improving their skills. A newcomer has no chance of competing against experienced players who have several ranked seasons under their belt.

The problem of training new players is still open. A huge amount of information of varying quality is available on the Internet. It's difficult for a beginner to navigate it. Some topics are basic, while others are tips for experienced players to polish their skills. It is difficult to distinguish the first from the second without sufficient experience. This book is an attempt to improve the existing situation.

The book contains material from reliable sources: guides, coaching sessions, and streams from professional players. It forms the minimum theoretical basis that every advanced player should know. The book consists of five chapters: psychological aspects of the game, general concepts, micromanagement, macromanagement, champions and builds. It will tell you how to approach ranked games correctly, what to do during the game, and how to study and develop your skills. The book will also be useful as a reference for self-coaching.

If you read this book and follow the advice given, you will definitely increase your Elo level by one or two ranks. Some exercises and techniques will require regular practice. Their positive effect will only become apparent over time. So please be patient.

Most of the presented material is general. It applies to all MOBA games. The discussed techniques will work well in League of Legends derivative games: Wild Rift and Mobile Legends. Much of this will also be relevant for Dota 2. The design of this game diverges greatly from League of Legends, but they share the same basic concepts.
